## The Advice: Communicate

The best piece of technical interview advice I have received and can impart upon you is to communicate, communicate, communicate! This may seem like an anti-climactic piece of advice, but I hope to be able to demonstrate to you that it’s actually the most important skill to prepare prior to an interview.

## What Do You Mean Communicate?

Let’s say you are in the interview and your interviewers throw you a whiteboard question. Do you step up to the whiteboard and feverishly start solving the problem?

**No!**

That tends to be everyone’s instinct, but it’s definitely not the right way to go. Even if you think you understand the problem, you should take some very important steps before moving forward.

## First, Restate the Question

Do you understand what they’re asking you to do? Prove it. Restate the question for them and seek affirmation. You might actually be surprised to find you don’t fully understand what they’re asking for — perhaps the question is similar, but not the same, as a practice problem you have completed in the past.

## Ask About Edge Cases

It’s still not time to dive right into coding the solution. Think for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem. Ask about them. In many cases, the interviewer hasn’t even thought about edge cases and will make something up.

## Ask About Test Cases

This is free and you should take advantage of it. Simply ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass. Your interviewer might be expecting you to ask this question, so it might be necessary. But it’s also possible the interviewer was not expecting the question and will think “ah, this candidate knows about testing!”

## Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense

you don’t actually want to start writing code in an actual language. You’ll find yourself constrained by trying to remember the methods or other idiosyncrasies of the language rather than trying to come up with the correct logic. Instead, let your interviewer know you’re going to start by writing pseudocode and fill in the actual code later.

## Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good

You should now convert your pseudocode into actual code. You don’t even need to remove the comments. At this point, you just need to plug the appropriate code for your language in.

## Stuck? Ask for Help

If you’re having trouble along the way, it’s not illegal to ask for some help. Just phrase it conversationally.

## remember

**Take a few minutes**

Speaking as an interview coach, this is one misstep that I see all the time during mock interviews. The canonical tip that everyone gives is, “talk more!”. What most of those well-meaning advice-givers overlook, however, is that talking and thinking at the same time is extremely hard. Nervous interviewees will jump straight into talking, passing up a great opportunity for concentrated thought.
